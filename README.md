# aws-cloudwatch-to-gelf
The goal of this project is to great a proof of concept service application that reads AWS CloudWatch logs and pushes them to Graylog in GELF HTTP format. Perhaps sometime in the future, this code could be migrated to a Graylog plugin. The idea here is to start simple.

I just started this on 08/04, so there's not much here yet. I'll have some basic functionality up within a few days.
